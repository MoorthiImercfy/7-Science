Question Type,Question,Answer,Explanation
Multiple Choice,The basic unit of matter is:,Atom,"An atom is the smallest particle of a chemical element that retains its chemical properties"
Multiple Choice,The subatomic particle that revolves around the nucleus is:,Electron,"Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in specific shells"
Multiple Choice,Which particle is positively charged?,Proton,"Protons are positively charged particles located in the nucleus"
Multiple Choice,The atomic number of an atom is:,Number of protons,"The atomic number (Z) equals the number of protons in an atom's nucleus"
Multiple Choice,Nucleons comprise of:,Protons and neutrons,"Protons and neutrons are collectively called nucleons as they reside in the nucleus"
Fill in the blanks,The smaller particles found in the atom are called ___,sub-atomic particles,"Atoms are made up of even smaller particles called sub-atomic particles"
Fill in the blanks,The nucleus has ___ and ___,Protons and Neutrons,"The nucleus contains both protons (positive charge) and neutrons (neutral charge)"
Fill in the blanks,The ___ revolve around the nucleus,electrons,"Electrons orbit the nucleus in specific shells or energy levels"
True or False,An atom is electrically neutral.,True,"An atom has equal numbers of protons (+) and electrons (-), making it neutral"
True or False,The electrons are positively charged.,False,"Electrons carry a negative charge, not positive"
True or False,The nucleus is surrounded by protons.,False,"The nucleus is surrounded by electrons, while protons are inside the nucleus"
Match the following,Valency|Electrons in the outermost orbit,"Valency is determined by the number of electrons in the outermost shell"
Match the following,Neutral Particle|Neutron,"Neutrons have no electrical charge, making them neutral particles"
Match the following,Positively charged Particle|Proton,"Protons carry a positive charge and are located in the nucleus"
Short Answer,What is atomic number?,Atomic number is the number of protons an atom contains.,"The atomic number uniquely identifies each element"
Short Answer,What is mass number of an atom?,It is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.,"Mass number = Number of protons + Number of neutrons"
Short Answer,What are valence electrons?,The number of electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as valence electrons.,"Valence electrons determine the chemical properties of an element"
Short Answer,What are nucleons?,Protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus of an atom and are thus called nucleons.,"These particles make up the nucleus and determine the atom's mass"
Long Answer,Explain Thomson's model of an atom.,"1. Thomson proposed that the atom has a positively charged part like the red part of a watermelon
2. Negatively charged particles (electrons) are embedded in it like seeds
3. The positive and negative charges are equal, making the atom neutral
4. This model proved the existence of electrons in atoms","Thomson's model was significant as it was the first to propose the existence of electrons, though it was later superseded by more accurate models"
Higher Order Thinking,Why can we use other metal foils instead of gold in Rutherford's experiment?,"1. Any highly malleable metal can be used because the experiment requires a very thin foil
2. Gold was used because it is highly malleable and could be made about 1000 atoms thick","This question tests understanding of experimental design and material properties"
Numerical Problem,If an atom has atomic number 9 and 10 neutrons, what is its mass number?,"The element is Fluorine
Mass number A = neutrons + protons
= 10 + 9 = 19
Therefore, mass number = 19","This problem demonstrates how to calculate mass number using atomic number and neutron count"
Assertion and Reason,Assertion: An atom is electrically neutral. Reason: Atoms have equal number of protons and electrons.,Both assertion and reason are true and reason explains the assertion.,"This tests understanding of atomic structure and electrical neutrality"
