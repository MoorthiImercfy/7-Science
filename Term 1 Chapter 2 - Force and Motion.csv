Question Type,Question,Answer,Explanation
Choose the appropriate answer,A particle is moving in a circular path of radius r. The displacement after half a circle would be,2r,The displacement is the diameter of the circle which is twice the radius
Choose the appropriate answer,Which of the following figures represent uniform motion of a moving object correctly?,Graph showing straight line with positive slope,A straight line in velocity-time graph represents uniform motion
Choose the appropriate answer,Suppose a boy is enjoying a ride on a merry go round which is moving with a constant speed of 10 m/s. It implies that the boy is,in accelerated motion,Though speed is constant direction changes continuously causing acceleration
Choose the appropriate answer,What is one way you might increase the stability of an object?,lower the centre of gravity,Lower center of gravity provides better stability
Fill in the blanks,The shortest distance between the two places is _____,displacement,Displacement is measured along straight line between initial and final positions
Fill in the blanks,The rate of change of velocity is _____,acceleration,Acceleration measures how quickly velocity changes
Fill in the blanks,If the velocity of an object increases with respect to time then the object is said to be in _____ acceleration,positive,Increasing velocity indicates positive acceleration
Fill in the blanks,The slope of the speed-time graph gives _____,velocity,The slope of speed vs time graph represents velocity
Fill in the blanks,In _____ equilibrium its centre of gravity remains at the same height when it is displaced,neutral,In neutral equilibrium object stays in any displaced position
True or False,All objects having uniform speed need not have uniform velocity,True,Objects in circular motion have constant speed but changing velocity due to changing direction
True or False,The acceleration gives the idea of how fast the position changes,False,Velocity gives idea of position change rate while acceleration shows velocity change rate
Match the following,Displacement,Metre,Basic unit of length measurement
Match the following,Light travels through vacuum,Uniform velocity,Light travels with constant speed in straight line
Match the following,Speed of ship,Knot,Nautical unit for ship speed
Match the following,Centre of gravity of geometrical shaped object,Geometric centre,For regular shapes center of gravity is at geometric center
Match the following,Stability,Larger base area,Wider base provides better stability
Analogy,velocity : metre/second :: acceleration : _____,metre/second²,Unit of acceleration is unit of velocity per second
Analogy,length of scale : metre :: speed of aeroplane : _____,knot,Standard units for respective measurements
Analogy,displacement/time : velocity :: speed/time : _____,acceleration,Mathematical relationships between motion quantities
Short Answer,What do you mean by constant acceleration?,A body is said to have constant acceleration if it travels in a straight line and its velocity increases or decreases by equal magnitude in equal intervals of time,Example: motion of freely falling body
Short Answer,What is centre of gravity?,The centre of gravity of an object is the point through which the entire weight of the object appears to act,This point represents the average position of weight distribution
Numerical Problem,Geetha takes 15 minutes from her house to reach her school on a bicycle. If the bicycle has a speed of 2 m/s calculate the distance between her house and the school.,1800 m,Time = 15 min = 900 s; Distance = Speed × Time = 2 × 900 = 1800 m
Numerical Problem,A car started from rest and travelling with velocity of 20 m/s in 10 s. What is its acceleration?,2 m/s²,Acceleration = Change in velocity/Time = (20-0)/10 = 2 m/s²
Higher Order Thinking,A bus can accelerate with an acceleration 1 m/s². Find the minimum time for the bus to reach the speed of 100 km/s from 50 km/s.,50000 s,Convert speeds to m/s; Time = Change in velocity/acceleration = (50000)/1 = 50000 s
