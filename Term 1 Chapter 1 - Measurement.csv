Give very short answer,What is the SI unit of temperature?,,Kelvin

Give very short answer,Define measurement,,Measurement is the comparison of an unknown quantity with a known fixed standard quantity

Give Short Answer,Explain the need for standard units,,Standard units are needed to maintain uniformity in measurements worldwide and avoid confusion in scientific communication

Answer in detail,Explain the different types of physical quantities with examples,,Physical quantities are of two types: 1) Fundamental quantities - These are independent quantities like length mass time etc. 2) Derived quantities - These are quantities derived from fundamental quantities like area volume speed etc.

Higher Order Thinking Skills,If you need to measure the thickness of a sheet of paper which measuring instrument would you use and why?,,I would use a screw gauge because it can measure very small lengths up to 0.01 mm accuracy. A paper's thickness is usually less than 1 mm so we need an instrument with high precision.
